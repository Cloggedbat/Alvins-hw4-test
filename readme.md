# password-generator

So this was a fun exersize, im definetly need to work on my Javascript skills and need to better understand local storage. The game is built on a Jquery based code that continualy changes Jumbotrons.
Honestly for the best results (for the high score) you should play this game twice...

From working with other people in my class I have seen many diffrent ways to make this work, the reason that I used Jquery was because it just clicked for me. In no way am I saying that I am a pro at it but I get it.
